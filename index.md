# About Me #

I am a software worker, in this dawn of the third industrial revolution.
I enjoy to program in C# and F#, in .NET. 
I graduated in electronic engineering, mostly forgot about it, i do like abstractions.


# Current Mantra List #
## subject to variation in time and space ##

* readable
* human
* the error is most probably where the compiler says
* composition over inheritance
* we constantly try to map higher dimensional spaces into lower dimensional spaces via projections
* too much fear makes the developer slow and useless
* please give us integration testing or e2e testing
* too little fear makes the developer dumb
* production testing with no test is panic attack
* class member variables are to be initialized by te constructor, fuck the builder pattern, pocos are ok but still why
* too many interfaces make guys go crazy
* a class/interface must have one or few purposes
* a class can implement multiple interfaces, but still better compose most of times
* dont repeat yourself
* keep it simple stupid
* logs are vital, must be meaningful, must be available
* type providers are super cool
* thread sucks, task is doable, async is nice, observables are cherry
* performance measurement needs some metrics
* a unit test is a test covering the conditional and branching logic of a unit
* a unit is the most reasonable portion of software containing logic
* dependency injection is ok 
* dynamic and object datatype are sometimes very evil (it is not javascript)
* di containers: + flexibility, - compiletime check
* object relational mapper: micro orm are cool, dapper is nice, Sql type provider is cooler
* swagger type provider is cool
* you can express polymorhism in different ways, interface inheritance and composition, generic polymorhism, union (sum|+) types
* usually separating data from behaviour is a good habit (fp)
* the observable pattern is also implemented by event handlers and event queues
* factory pattern does not solve all your problems
* most of OOP code is POO code, being procedural
* curry howard isomorphism is cool
* cathegory theory is cool
* i like cats, not dogs
* git command line
* visual studio code is a nice text editor
